Human detection is the process of finding the location and size of every person in each video frame. It can be done by using various methods such as template matching, feature extraction, or deep learning. Template matching compares a small area of the image with known patterns of people, such as silhouettes or body parts. Feature extraction uses some characteristics of people, such as color, texture, or shape, to distinguish them from the background. Deep learning uses neural networks to learn complex representations of people from large amounts of data.

Human tracking is a challenging task because of various factors such as occlusion, illumination, pose variation, and camera motion. Therefore, many researchers are working on developing more robust and accurate methods for human tracking in computer vision.
